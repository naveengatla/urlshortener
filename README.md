# urlshortener
using AWS Lambda and API gateway to URL shortening and redirection

Project Overview:
In the digital age, the need for secure, convenient and ephemeral URLs has become paramount. Our service, Serverless URL Shortener with Expiration Feature, addresses this need by providing a simple solution for creating late connections. Leveraging the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS), our application enables users to create temporary, easily shared links to time-sensitive information. By adding a passing element, our short URL promotes privacy and security, ensuring that shared links can only be accessed for a limited time. With user-friendly interfaces and robust back-end infrastructure, our work facilitates secure information sharing.

Cloud Service and Technologies:
Cloud Service: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Technologies: AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon API Gateway, Amason S3 to host static wesite, HTML, Javascript

Major Features/Functions:
URL Shortening: Users can input long URLs and receive unique shortened links.
Expiration Feature: Users can set an expiration time for the shortened links (in seconds).
Redirection: Shortened URLs redirect users to the original long URLs.
